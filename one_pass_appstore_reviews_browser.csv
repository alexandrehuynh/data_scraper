appstore_review_1,Love One Pass App!,"I already loved One Pass prior to the mobile app, but I must say, I love it even more with this new feature! What a convenient way to access all that One Pass has to offer. Especially useful when you need to find a gym on the fly or when traveling. Cant wait to see what else this team has in store for the future!

appstore_review_2,SCAMMERS!! STAY AWAY!,"They removed the only gym that I use on onepass at the start of the new year without ever telling me. So now my onepass is useless to me. I request a refund and cancellation on the phone. They told me they would cancel my account and issue me a refund for that month. Perfect. Next month comes around and I am charged for another month of useless onepass! What!?! First customer support person had no clue. Call back and am told I will be refunded for both months now but they will “follow up in 3-5 business days”. 7 business day later… no response. I call again, gets escalated, and I receive an email an hour later saying I am not eligible for a refund!!!? What!!? They’re also going to charge me for another month just because they want to.

Hardly any gym offerings anymore. Not worth the money. I wish I could leave a negative -10 star review

appstore_review_3,Buyer Beware,"I heard about OnePass from Kaiser, whom I trust. I could use some fitness motivation. I saw on their list of participating fitness centers a gym I was interested in going to… Immediately signed up and paid the enrollment fee.
On my lunch break a few hours later that same day, I visited that gym and was told they are no longer with OnePass. What? How can that be?? Disappointed, I went back to my OnePass account to cancel and request a refund, and couldn’t.
A month later, OnePass said they did an investigation and determined I didn’t qualify for a refund. That made no sense. Unfortunately, that’s how they do business.

My advice to you newbies is to physically show up to the place you want to exercise to make sure they are actively participating with OnePass BEFORE you sign up with OnePass. Once they have your money, they are keeping it. I wish I knew that.
